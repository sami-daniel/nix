In both the inotify and fanotify `read_events(...)` APIs:

Remove logic with `MaybeUninit` + `ptr::copy_nonoverlapping` and use `ptr::read_unaligned`, leaving the code more concise and clean on both sides, without the redundant check using `.min()`

Use `Vec::with_capacity(nread / size)` instead of allocating empty space. Useful for increasing performance in case of event bursts. Allocates space to spare, but is still more performant than allocating almost empty space

In inotify `read_events`:

Reduce the event name iteration window to the maximum byte size (which is `event.len`), without risking reading beyond the event name in any way and without needing to scan again using `CStr::from_ptr` and increasing perfomance
